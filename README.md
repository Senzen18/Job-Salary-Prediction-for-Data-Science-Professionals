# Job Salary Prediction for Data Science Professionals
[Selenium, Machine Learning, Bag of words, TF-IDF, NLTK]

•Created a Machine Learning based Job Salary predictor
for data-related positions sourced from Glassdoor.com.
•Performed data cleaning & feature engineering with
NLTK

•Demonstrating EDA results with word cloud map & PCA
on TF-IDF word embeddings.

•Utilizing Machine learning on job salary interval
prediction with Random Forest, SVM, Logistic
Regression, to select best model with accuracy of 0.71.
### Look at Modelling for different model implementations
