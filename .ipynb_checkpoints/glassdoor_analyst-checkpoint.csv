Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.
We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).
We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

What Can You Expect?
Project– InnoWaste product
Business problem: Business Waste (BW) is a product the Client invested in the production, where the expected financial return isn’t realized. When the Client brings new products to the market (innovation process), there is BW created from new products brought to the market, and the BW created by the products gets delisted/changed/replaced. In the current process, BW is viewed at a late stage when there is no time anymore to take preventive actions.
Objective: Create earlier insight into potential BW and enable action to prevent BW. InnoWaste should allow the Client to monitor, control, and reduce Business waste created as part of the innovation process. The first focus is on products that get delisted/changed/replaced. InnoWaste needs to ensure that the required data is gathered on time to make it easy to simulate scenarios for E2E planners in Rapid Response (by Kinaxis) and make it easy to set and track the actions that will lead to the execution of these scenarios. The target user is P&I (Portfolio and Innovation, Supply Chain partner for marketing). Other users will be E2E planning, R&D, marketing, demand planning, material planning, and procurement. The MVP is live.
Manufacturing product:
Background: As part of the Real-Time Visibility and Analytics program (RTVA), Power BI dashboards have been created with the most critical KPIs for the factories. Bringing visibility on KPI, however, does not automatically lead to better business results.
Objective: Pivot the RTVA Make product so it can lead to better business results. Solutions do not need to be restricted to the use of the currently used technology. What the answer is will need to be found. Current ideas on which business targets to adopt: Increase Operational Reliability, decrease production cost/ ton, drop CO2/ton.
Teams’ way of working:
The team follows agile principles. The team’s success will be measured based on the business KPI, not putting project KPIs as budget and planning central. The team’s core skill is the use of discovery techniques.
Profile sketch Business Analyst InnoWaste – SAP knowledge
Context: The team currently has one Business Analyst with core skills in interviewing users, creating conceptual models of logic, testing, and documentation for the business to understand. The team also holds a data SME with knowledge of the data available in the Data Lake, turning the conceptual models into concrete logic and specifications for the Data Lake.
Primary need: For further rollout and enhancements, there will be a need to explore data not yet available in the Data Lake, specifically data in SAP instances. There is a need for someone in the team who can lead data exploration, understand with users and other technical experts what exact data table/ set is needed, and be able to take downloads from there to do early testing if it applies to our purpose.
Qualities:
Have SAP knowledge.
Experience with Rapid Response (by Kinaxis) is a pre-requisite.
Experience working in SC or innovation processes is a pre-requisite.
To complement other strengths in the team will be an advantage to have a strong bias for action and be result-driven.
Profile sketch Business Analyst Manufacturing
Context: The team will have three BAs, each leading the work on one of the business targets. The BA must work closely with the UX designer, the Data SME, and the developers. The Product Manager will support coaching and keep end responsibility of budget, planning, and business value. However, the BA is expected to be the driver for their respective business targets.
