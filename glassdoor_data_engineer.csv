There are numerous high risk categories that we are focused on now that will continue to expand: youth (cribs, bunk beds, etc.), hazardous goods (lithium batteries, coolant, etc.), composite wood, etc. Verifying these products not only protects Wayfair, but more importantly, our customers that purchase these products.
Supplier Diligence: Wayfair is a platform that allows furniture suppliers to sell their products to the end user customers on our site. We are onboarding new suppliers and need to verify existing suppliers with new requirements. There are for main areas we are focused on now:
Is the business information provided accurate and can we verify that it is a legitimate business (Know Your Business - KYB)?
Is there a representative of the business that we can verify is associated with this business (Know Your Customer - KYC)?
Is the bank and payment information accurate and verifiable?
Does this supplier have insurance that meets our requirements?
As mentioned above, these are the areas that we’re currently focused on, but there are multiple other verticals within Legal that we need to expand into: corporate security, privacy, real estate, customs, etc.

Responsibilities:
Work cross-functionally with different roles and teams, such as product management, core areas of the business, and other engineering teams to understand the problems we need to solve, and solution against them in a globally distributed environment.
Own the entire platform's architecture and help make decisions to drive the technology platform and roadmap for the team to ensure current and future scalability and performance - you'll be helping us solve some complex architectural problems!Implement and advocate for engineering best practices, helping level up the engineers inside and outside your team

About Us:
Platform9: A Better Way to Go Cloud Native

Cloud native is a strategic priority for technology leaders at nearly every company around the world. Going to cloud native is a complex, challenging, but necessary process for businesses and organisations, regardless of size or industry.

As cloud native grows and matures, many enterprises are looking to leverage powerhouse technologies like Kubernetes to accelerate their adoption, but they are faced with a limited set of options.

The Roku Culture
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement changes in their digital businesses. Some may think we are “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we are also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do – you cannot put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Do not care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That is cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and the world changing? Be you, with us!

Take onboarding, for example.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!
Why Cisco?
#WeAreCisco. We are all unique, but collectively we bring our talents to work as a team, to develop innovative technology and power a more inclusive, digital future for everyone. How do we do it? Well, for starters – with people like you!
Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.
We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).
We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us! #WeAreCisco

About the job
Systems Development Engineering (SDE) at Google is a role where you manage services and systems at scale. SDEs creatively put their engineering discipline to use automating the mundane and reducing toil. We don’t just write code to fix bugs, but emphasize the development of tools and solutions that fix classes of problems. We know it’s hard to control what you can’t measure – so we focus on observability: instrumenting first, then turning data into knowledge, and finally knowledge into action. We know that the operational efficiency of Google systems, services, virtual compute environments and the operating systems that power them impact the environment, not just the bottom line. We know that working together we can do more, and that community matters.

Google brings together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage them to collaborate, think big and take risks in a blame-free environment. We promote self-direction to work on meaningful projects, while we also strive to create an environment that provides the support and mentorship needed to learn and grow.

Together we engineer and build the infrastructure, tools, access and telemetry for systems that enable orchestration of Google-scale services. Come build things that matter.

Google Distributed Cloud Hosted (GDCH) is designed as a converged hardware/software solution for customers who want the benefits of Google Cloud on premises. GDCH will include dedicated hardware (e.g., rack, network switch, servers, storage), operating system, and selected first-party GCP services.

Google Cloud accelerates organizations’ ability to digitally transform their business with the best infrastructure, platform, industry solutions and expertise. We deliver enterprise-grade solutions that leverage Google’s cutting-edge technology – all on the cleanest cloud in the industry. Customers in more than 200 countries and territories turn to Google Cloud as their trusted partner to enable growth and solve their most critical business problems.
Responsibilities
Understand the service parameters of the server portfolio and validate it against the product requirements, consider both the physical and software characteristics (e.g., power, cooling, rack space, network connectivity), and the scale constraints of the software control plane.
Manage the engineering NPI (New Product Introduction) to manage changes and evolution of GDCH hardware design.
Validate the performance characteristics of resources to make sure their latency, throughput, computation, and capacity parameters align with the customer requirements and GDCH roadmap.
Ensure the hardware components meet the security and compliance requirements by collaborating with GDCH security, Google security, and industry security consortium and compliance bodies.
Automate and document the operational tasks to deploy and maintain the hardware component.

About Avalara:
We’re building cloud-based tax compliance solutions to handle every transaction in the world. Imagine every transaction you make — every tank of gas, cup of coffee, or pair of sneakers, every movie ticket, meal kit, or streamed song, every sensor-to-sensor ping. Nearly every time you make a purchase, physical or digital, there’s an accompanying unique and nuanced tax compliance calculation. The logic behind calculating taxes — the rules, rates, and boundaries is a global, layered, three-dimensional mess of complexity, with compliance dictated by governments and applied by every business, every day.

Avalara works with businesses of all sizes, all over the world — from corner stores to gigantic global retailers — to calculate tax accurately and automatically, at speeds measured in milliseconds. That’s a massive technical challenge, in terms of scale, reliability, and complexity, and we do it better than anyone. That’s why we’re growing fast. Headquartered in Seattle, Avalara has offices across the U.S. and around the world, in Brazil, Canada, India, U.K, Belgium and across Europe.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement changes in their digital businesses. Some may think we are “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we are also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do – you cannot put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Do not care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That is cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and the world changing? Be you, with us!
